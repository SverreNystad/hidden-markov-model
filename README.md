# HiddenMarkovModel 
This Python program implements a basic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) class, capable of performing the forward algorithm to compute probabilities of observation sequences. The program also includes a simple example of the HMM class in action, using a toy example of a weather model.

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed, then set up your environment:
```bash	
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Execute the program to see the HMM in action:
```bash
python hidden_markov_models.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests, execute:
```bash
pytest
```
